# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup React Native Project with TypeScript
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Configure essential dependencies and establish the project structure for the existing HomEE mobile application React Native project with TypeScript.
# Details:
The React Native project with TypeScript template has already been created. The following tasks need to be completed:

1. Setup project structure:
```
/src
  /assets - Images, icons, etc.
  /commonUI - Reusable UI components
  /hooks - Custom hooks
  /frameworkConfig - Configuration files
  /dataModels - TypeScript type definitions
  /database - Database related code
  /sideEffects - Side effects management
  /services - Business logic services
  /constants - App constants
  /navigation - Navigation configuration
  /screens - App screens
  /styles - Styling utilities
  /utils - Utility functions
```

2. Configure essential dependencies:
- Navigation: @react-navigation/native, @react-navigation/bottom-tabs, @react-navigation/stack
- State management: Redux Toolkit
- Form handling: react-hook-form
- Network requests: axios
- UI components: react-native-elements or similar

3. Configure ESLint and Prettier for code quality
4. Create basic example components and screens to validate the structure

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify project builds successfully for both iOS and Android
2. Run basic smoke tests to ensure the app launches without errors
3. Validate TypeScript configuration works correctly
4. Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed and imported
5. Verify ESLint and Prettier configurations work as expected
6. Test basic example components and screens to validate the project structure

# Subtasks:
## 1.1. Create Project Directory Structure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the recommended folder structure for the project and create placeholder files to establish the architecture.
### Details:
Create the following directory structure in the /src folder:
- /assets - Images, icons, etc.
- /commonUI - Reusable UI components
- /hooks - Custom hooks
- /frameworkConfig - Configuration files
- /dataModels - TypeScript type definitions
- /database - Database related code
- /sideEffects - Side effects management
- /services - Business logic services
- /constants - App constants
- /navigation - Navigation configuration
- /screens - App screens
- /styles - Styling utilities
- /utils - Utility functions

Add README.md files in each directory explaining its purpose. Create placeholder index.ts files in each directory to ensure proper exports. Set up barrel exports (index.ts files that re-export components) for cleaner imports.

## 1.2. Install and Configure Essential Dependencies [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Install and set up all required third-party libraries for navigation, state management, form handling, network requests, and UI components.
### Details:

#### 1. Navigation
```
yarn add @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/bottom-tabs @react-navigation/stack
yarn add react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context
```
- Purpose: Enables navigation between screens (stack, tabs, etc.).
- Config: Set up navigation containers in `src/navigation/`.

#### 2. State Management (Redux Toolkit)
```
yarn add @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux
```
- Purpose: Global state management.
- Config: Create your store in `src/frameworkConfig/redux/` or `src/store/`.

#### 3. Form Handling
```
yarn add react-hook-form
```
- Purpose: Build and validate forms easily.
- Config: Use in your form components in `src/screens/` or `src/commonUI/`.

#### 4. Network Requests
```
yarn add axios
```
- Purpose: HTTP client for API requests.
- Config: Create a base API client in `src/services/apiClient.ts`.

#### 5. UI Components
```
yarn add react-native-elements
```
- Purpose: Prebuilt UI components for faster development.
- Config: Use in your components in `src/commonUI/`.

#### 6. Internationalization
```
yarn add i18next react-i18next
```
- Purpose: Multi-language support.
- Config: Set up configuration in `src/frameworkConfig/i18next/`.

#### 7. Async Storage
```
yarn add @react-native-async-storage/async-storage
```
- Purpose: Persistent key-value storage.
- Config: Use for caching and storing user/session data.

#### 8. Linting and Formatting
```
yarn add --dev eslint prettier eslint-plugin-react eslint-plugin-react-native @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin @typescript-eslint/parser eslint-plugin-prettier eslint-config-prettier
```
- Purpose: Code quality and formatting.
- Config: Place config files in the project root.

#### 9. Testing
```
yarn add --dev jest @testing-library/react-native @testing-library/jest-native jest-react-native
```
- Purpose: Unit and integration testing.
- Config: Set up in `package.json` or `jest.config.js`.

For each library:
- After installation, follow the official documentation for initial setup.
- Place configuration files and code in the appropriate directories as described above.
- Create simple example usages to verify integration.

## 1.3. Configure Code Quality Tools [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up and configure ESLint and Prettier for code quality and formatting consistency.
### Details:
Install ESLint and Prettier as dev dependencies. Configure ESLint with TypeScript and React Native plugins. Create .eslintrc.js and .prettierrc files with appropriate rules. Add lint and format scripts to package.json. Configure VSCode settings for the project to use ESLint and Prettier. Run linting on the existing codebase and fix any issues.

## 1.4. Create Basic Example Components and Screens [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop basic example components and screens to validate the project structure and configuration.
### Details:
Create a simple HomeScreen component in the screens directory. Implement a basic reusable Button component in the commonUI directory. Set up a simple navigation flow between 2-3 screens using React Navigation. Create a basic Redux store with a simple slice for demonstration. Implement a form using react-hook-form. Create a simple API service using axios. Ensure all examples follow the established project structure and coding standards.
